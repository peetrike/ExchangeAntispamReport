# ExchangeAntispamReport

This Powershell module contains Exchange Server antispam report scripts that come included in Exchange Server media.  But they don't work unmodified.

I took those scripts, modified them to make them work and then added them into module.  As a bonus, the module has function to establish remote Exchagne serve connection to be able to get access to antispam agent logs.  Through that established connection it is possible to bring Exchange management commands to local computer
