SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes module that helps to create reports from Exchange Server antispam agent logs.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    ExchangeAntiSpamReport is a module that takes log entries from Exchange Server antispam agent logs and 
    creates reports based on them.  Most of the reports count specific senders, Sender IP-s, recipients or
    agents that are part of rejecting messages.

    Before generating report, a connection to Exchange Server should be established.  When module is used from
    Exchange Management Shell, the connection is already present.  When generic Powershell console is used, then
    before using other commands, the Connect-ExchangeServer cmdlet will make PowerShell remoting session to
    specified Exchange Server and import Exchange management cmdlets from that session.

    Possible reporting cmdlets are:

    Get-AntispamReport                 - reports top agents that performed specific action
    Get-AntispamTopBlockedSender       - reports top blocked sender e-mail addressess
    Get-AntispamTopBlockedSenderDomain - reports top blocked sender e-mail address domains
    Get-AntispamTopBlockedSenderIP     - reports top blocked senders by IP address
    Get-AntispamTopRBLProvider         - reports top RBL providers
    Get-AntispamTopRecipient           - reports top blocked e-mail recipient addresses
